# Remora-EC500-DMAstepgen

This repo is used to share the work done to develop a DMA driven port buffer step generator. The algorithm and DMA logic works but the STM32 cannot process the step pattern quick enough. It therefore is not useable.

Do not use this and expect it to work. For development info only!
